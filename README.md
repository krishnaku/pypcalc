## üîç Overview

`pypcalc` provides a formal foundation and practical tools for modeling, measuring, and analyzing *presence* ‚Äî 
a unifying concept for modeling and measuring "flow" in systems ranging from simple, linear systems to complex, 
stochastic and non-linear systems. 

The toolkit includes implementations for key concepts of The Presence Calculus, including

- A `Presence` class representing the fundamental unit of analysis. 
- The `PresenceMatrix` for computing over presences.
- The `PresenceInvariant` that expresses the fundamental invariant of The Presence Calculus. 

In addition to base implementations we also provide 

- Support for optional export to `pandas` or `polars` and imports from csv files for barebones integration with external models.
- Examples showing how to use the concepts in different contexts, including simulations and real-time sources, as well as how to use it for causal analysis, and modeling flow in complex adaptive systems

## üì¶ Installation

Install the core package:

```bash
pip install pypcalc
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install pypcalc[pandas,polars]
```

---

## üöÄ Quickstart

```python
from pcalc.presence import PresenceAssertion

# A presence record indicating an element existed in a boundary from t=0 to t=10
p = PresenceAssertion(element="job-42", boundary="system-a", onset_time=0.0, reset_time=10.0)

print(p.mass())  # Outputs: 10.0
```

For more advanced usage, see examples in the repository.
