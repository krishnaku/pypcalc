## üîç Overview

`pypcalc` is a python library that provides a reference implementation for the concepts
in [The Presence Calculus](https://docs.pcalc.org)

The toolkit includes implementations for key concepts of The Presence Calculus, including

- A `Presence` class representing the fundamental unit of analysis. 
- The `PresenceMatrix` for computing over presences.
- The `PresenceInvariant` that expresses the fundamental invariant of The Presence Calculus. 

In addition to base implementations we plan to provide 

- Support for optional export to `pandas` or `polars` and imports from csv files for barebones integration with external models.
- Integration APIs to use the calculus in different contexts, including simulations and real-time sources, as well as how to use it for causal analysis, and modeling flow in complex adaptive systems

STATUS: The current implementation should be considered pre-alpha quality and not ready for production use. 
When a releasable library is available, we will publish it as a package on PyPi. 

For now, it is best to think of the code in this repository as a concrete, but evolving implementation of the 
high level concepts we talk about in the documentation.
