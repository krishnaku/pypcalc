A *Presence* is the foundational assertion in the Presence Calculus. It states
that a specific element was continuously present within a specific boundary
over a defined time interval.

Formally, a presence is represented as a 4-tuple:

$$
p = (e, b, t_0, t_1)
$$

where:
- $e \in E$ is the element (thing),
- $b \in B$ is the boundary (place),
- $[t_0, t_1)$ is the half-open interval of presence in time.

A presence can be viewed as a function:

$$
P: E \\times B \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}
$$


where


- $P(e, b, t_0, t_1) = 1$  if $e$ is present in $b$ during $[t_0, t_1)$
- $P(e, b, t_0, t_1) = 0$  otherwise

Note that P maps into ℝ (real numbers), rather than into the Boolean set {0, 1}.
This is because applying a time scale to presences—for example, by binning time into discrete intervals —
can yield fractional values for presence. These fractional values represent partial overlap with a bin
and enable presence to be interpreted as a continuous, additive quantity. See class [TimeScale](./time_scale.html) for
more details.

This real-valued interpretation supports robust aggregation, smoothing, and rate-based calculations
within the calculus even as we apply scaling factors to the input timeline.

### Presence onset and reset

$t_0$ is called the <em>onset time</em> of the presence—the instant at which the
presence transitions from zero to non-zero. $t_1$ is called the *reset time* —
the instant at which the presence transitions back to zero.

We will say the presence is *active*
over the half-open interval $[t_0, t_1)$, meaning it
includes $t_0$ but excludes $t_1$.

  </div>
</div>

This diagram illustrates a presence assertion over a half-open interval
$[t_0, t_1)$, where element $e$ is continuously present in boundary $b$
starting at $t_0$ (included) and ending just before $t_1$ (excluded).

### The Time Model

Time in the presence calculus is modeled as a continuous quantity over $\mathbb{R}$.
When interfacing with external systems that operate in wallclock time you will need to
convert between timestamps and dates and floating point numbers when constructing presence assertions.

The [TimeModel](./time_model.html) class (`pcalc.time_model.TimeModel`) is provided for this purpose.

### Validity of Presence Assertions

It is crucial to note that the Presence Calculus treats presence assertions
as **axiomatic**: it does not question or make inferences about their validity.

If a presence assertion is derived from point-in-time events, the meaning of
that derivation must be defined within the domain itself.

For example, suppose in a traffic domain we observe that a vehicle (the element) crossed the
1-mile marker at 11:00 AM and the 2-mile marker at 11:10 AM. If we assert that
the vehicle was continuously present (i.e., within the boundary between those
markers) during the interval [11:00, 11:11), that assertion depends on
domain-level assumptions—such as continuity of motion, absence of detours,
or the nonexistence of teleportation.

In a different domain—for example, one in which a wormhole allows instantaneous
travel between Mars and mile 1.6—such an assertion might be invalid.

The Presence Calculus does **not** attempt to resolve or validate such
assumptions. It simply assumes that all presence assertions are valid according
to domain semantics and proceeds to compute their consequences.


### Topology

This brings us to a fundamental distinction between a presence assertion and a
point-in-time event: a presence assertion introduces a natural way to define a
**topology** on the space of entities, boundaries, and time intervals
\( E \times B \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \).

This means that presence assertions allow us to reason about concepts such as
**nearness**, **overlap**, **continuity**, and **structure**—that is, how
things relate across elements, boundaries, and time.

The consequences of presence assertions are not logical in the classical sense,
but **topological**: they give rise to notions of proximity, flow, and
co-presence that reveal the shape, connectedness and dynamics of the domain.

With presence, we can detect patterns such as:
- elements that tend to be present together (co-presence),
- transitions between boundaries, and
- regions of concentrated or evolving presence.

Presence thus provides the foundational structure for understanding the **dynamics
of entities** in a domain.
