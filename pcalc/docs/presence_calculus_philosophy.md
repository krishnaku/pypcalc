The Presence Calculus posits that mathematics is a valid and useful way of
describing reality — particularly when it comes to structured observation,
measurement, and reasoning.

For systems best understood in terms of hazard and reward signals and their
interactions, *presence* — rather than entities or state — offers a more
powerful reasoning primitive. Most business-critical decision making rests on
these kinds of signals and we are focused on solving real-world problems.

That said, these questions invariably intersect the philosophical realm, and
it's useful to situate our work in that context.

The presence calculus assumes that precise mathematical reasoning is essential
for understanding certain aspects of complex systems — especially where
structured observation, measurement, and interaction over time are involved.

The calculus doesn’t try to model the world as a process of pure becoming, nor
does it posit a maximal, fully specified prior ontology. Instead, it operates
with a minimal, constructive ontology: treating 'presence' as something that can
be asserted, measured, and reasoned about, rather than presuming a specific
metaphysical status for the underlying reality. It accepts a pragmatic realism
about what can be observed and quantified.

Presence is treated as an *epistemic unit* relative to an observer defined
boundary. It reflects what is currently observed to exist within a system of
signals in a way that supports structured analysis and practical intervention.
The calculus is concerned with identifying what is *available to reason about*
and *possible to act upon*.

Philosophically, this approach sits somewhere between Whitehead [@whitehead1978]
and Deleuze [@deleuze1994]. Whitehead emphasized the structured unfolding of
becoming — events, states, and transitions that give rise to coherent processes.
Deleuze, by contrast, emphasized the irreducible multiplicity of flows,
intensities, and differences that resist stable identity or fixed
representation.

The Presence Calculus sits in between: it provides a structured, formal account
of presence as it unfolds within a given system, while recognizing that multiple
systems of presence may interact in ways that are not globally predictable or
fully knowable. It acknowledges both the value of internal structure and the
reality of external contingency, and focuses on what can be asserted and acted
on in the midst of that tension.

Relative to Whitehead, the Presence Calculus focuses not just on the raw process
of 'becoming' (the onset of signals), but on the structured quantification of '
being' as the measurable outcome or accumulation of that becoming over defined
intervals. It models how continuous processes are observed and consolidated into
discrete, analyzable units of presence, thereby revealing the coherent structure
within becoming and the stable patterns of being. It treats the accumulation of
observable presence over timescales as structured and deterministic —
analyzable, composable, and bounded — encompassing both becoming and being.

Relative to Deleuze, it recognizes that *multiple such systems coexist and
interact*, often in ways that are not entirely knowable or controllable. But the
deterministic behavior of presence accumulation in individual systems of
presence give us the levers to steer the system-of-systems.

Reward signals, hazard signals, and other forms of presence may each follow
internal rules, but their *interactions are contingent*, and their combined
dynamics are not assumed to be globally solvable.

In this sense, the calculus focuses less on discovering a complete model of the
system and more on  *supporting informed steering* — interpreting signal flows,
observing patterns of convergence or divergence, and making local interventions
based on the mathematically precise semantics of what's observable.

It does not give up on structure, rather it acknowledges that structure and
emergence coexist. The calculus provides a way to reason rigorously within each
presence domain while recognizing that the system as a whole is always in
motion, always partially observed, and always responsive to human agency.

This makes it a substrate for modeling and measurement, and for reasoning and
decision-making in systems where formal analysis coexists with meaning,
emergence, and human agency. It recognizes that our analytical models are not
separate from the systems they describe, but are themselves tools through which
human agency interprets and steers complex processes.

This makes it a _substrate_ for modeling and measurement in systems of presence,
and also for reasoning and decision-making in systems of systems that are only
partially knowable.

Ultimately though, our focus is pragmatic, not philosophical. The Presence
Calculus is a low-level utility — and its value lies in concrete applications,
many of them aimed at solving mundane business problems, where the greater
expressiveness of the calculus gives us incrementally better ways to analyze the
real-world systems we live in.
