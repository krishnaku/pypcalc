If you prefer audio to text, here is a summary of [The Presence Calculus - A Gentle Introduction](./intro_to_presence_calculus.html) that was
produced using Google's NotebookLM. 

There are a couple of glitches here and there, and maybe a couple of points
where I would quibble with the interpretation, but by and large this is a
remarkably astute summary of the key things I would want someone to take away
from this document.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="../assets/pandoc/presence_calculus_overview.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</div>

The AI was fed this document as well as all the mathematical source material on the 
[Theory Track](../theory_track.html) and I have to say it has done a great job of turning this into a coherent conversation
on a rather obscure topic!
