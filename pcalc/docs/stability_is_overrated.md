## Stability is overrated

Software is not like manufacturing. Manufacturing processes produce the same things over and over again and the techniques
used to analyze manufacturing processes have no value for software development because it is knowledge work involving humans working
in a complex adaptive system.

This is a fairly entrenched view in software development, and the advocates for Lean software development are inevitably confronted
with this argument.  In spite of ample evidence over nearly 20 years of practice that techniques such reducing WIP, visualizing work and managing
work queues, measuring flow metrics and using them to analyze process bottlenecks - all techniques more or less inspired by related ideas
in manufacturing are very effective in reducing process waste in software development, just as they were in manufacturing. 

That said, software is not manufacturing, and the question is where the dividing line lies.  When does 
importing assembly line management concepts to software start becoming counter-productive?
