% The Presence Manifold

Since there are only two degrees of freedom theses system trajectories will
always lie on a two dimensional manifold in a 3 dimensional space.

All solutions to an equation of the form $x=y \times z,$ which is the
form of the presence invariant, lie on a 2D surface, called a manifold in 3
dimensions: think of the manifold a rubber sheet suspended in a 3 dimensional
space. All the values of $x, y, \text{ and } z$  that satisfy this equation will
lie on the surface of this rubber sheet. This is a powerful geometric constraint
that we can exploit to reason about the possible behavior of a system of
presences over time.
