This document proposes a natural complex-valued representation for presence dynamics, based on the multiplicative structure of the presence invariant.

## The Presence Invariant

Let:

- Average mass of presence: $$ H $$
- Incidence rate (activations per unit time): $$ \\\Lambda $$
- Residence time (average duration per activation): $$ G $$

Then the presence invariant is:

$$
H = \\\Lambda \\\cdot G
$$

This constraint defines a 2D surface in $$ \\\mathbb{R}^3 $$:

$$
M = \\\{ (H, \\\Lambda, G) \\\in \\\mathbb{R}^3_{\\\geq 0} \\\mid H = \\\Lambda \\\cdot G \\\}
$$

## Complex Embedding

Define the **presence signature** as a complex number:

$$
z := \\\log \\\Lambda + i \\\log G
$$

This gives:

- $$ \\\text{Re}(z) = \\\log \\\Lambda $$
- $$ \\\text{Im}(z) = \\\log G $$
- $$ H = e^z $$

That is:

$$
\\\log H = \\\text{Re}(z) + \\\text{Im}(z)
$$

So:

- $$ \\\Lambda = e^{\\\text{Re}(z)} $$
- $$ G = e^{\\\text{Im}(z)} $$
- $$ H = e^z = e^{\\\log \\\Lambda + i \\\log G} = \\\Lambda \\\cdot G^i $$

## Interpretation

The complex number $$ z $$ represents the **log-flow signature** of a presence regime:

- The **angle** $$ \\\theta = \\\text{Arg}(z) = \\\tan^{-1}(\\\log G / \\\log \\\Lambda) $$ encodes the relative dominance of duration vs incidence.
- The **modulus** $$ |z| = \\\sqrt{(\\\log \\\Lambda)^2 + (\\\log G)^2} $$ encodes the intensity of the regime.
- Total presence mass is recovered as $$ H = e^z $$.

## Geometric Insights

This embedding enables:

- Visualization of presence regimes as points in $$ \\\mathbb{C} $$
- Clustering of flow modes by angular sectors
- A metric space over presence regimes:

$$
d(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2| = \\\sqrt{(\\\log \\\Lambda_1 - \\\log \\\Lambda_2)^2 + (\\\log G_1 - \\\log G_2)^2}
$$

## Conclusion

Mapping presence invariants to the complex plane via log-linear coordinates yields a rich geometric and algebraic structure. It captures the balance between incidence and residence as a **direction**, and the total flow accumulation as an **exponential magnitude**. This representation supports both visualization and metric analysis of dynamic flow systems.
