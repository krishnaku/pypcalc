## What is The Presence Calculus?

The Presence Calculus is a formalism for reasoning about the relationship  
between things, places, and time — through the lens of measurable  
*presence*.

Our primary goal is to support rigorous modeling and principled  
decision-making with data in complex, real-world domains, while ensuring  
that the use of data in such decisions rests on a mathematically  
precise, logically coherent, and epistemically grounded foundation.

The presence calculus emerged from a search for better quantitative tools to  
reason about complex systems in software development, where the current  
state of measurement is severely deficient in all of these aspects.

As you’ll see, these ideas are far more general, with applications well  
beyond software.

Formally, the presence calculus builds on mathematical concepts from measure  
theory, topology, and complex analysis, and connects it to stochastic  
process dynamics, queueing theory, and complex systems science.

The foundational constructs of the calculus allow us to define derived  
notions such as flow, stability, equilibrium, and coherence in complex  
systems precisely, and to relate them to practically useful measures like  
delay, cost, revenue, and user experience.

In this document, we'll motivate our ideas using simplified real-world  
decision problems.

While the calculus was developed with mathematical rigor, an  
equally important goal was not to let mathematics get in the way of  
understanding the rather simple but very powerful and general ideas  
embodied by the calculus.

Our goal is to make this framework accessible enough to build powerful  
applications on top of it — not just for us, but for anyone working with  
complex systems. 

## Learning more about The Presence Calculus

In this document, we'll motivate and introduce the key ideas in the calculus informally, with lots of simplified examples
to illustrate concepts. It is aimed squarely at the non-technical reader. We recommend reading and understanding the ideas here before jumping deeper into rest of the
documentation at this site.

The next level of detail is in The API docs for the [The Presence Calculus Toolkit](https://py.pcalc.org), Here 
we go into the concepts at a level of rigor and you'll need to work with the pcalc API and build tools using the concepts.
Some mathematical background will be useful here if you want to work on the core. 

Finally for those who want to see the underlying mathematical underpinnings of the calculus, we have
the theory track which perhaps goes into more detail than most people will likely need to read or
understand, but is useful for the mathematically trained to connect the ideas in pcalc to its roots in 
mainstream mathematics. 

Lets  jump in with an first example.
